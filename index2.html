 <p>Hi, My name is Marc Hall
I am 54 years old and I live with my wife, Martha, in a small town next to Charlotte, North Carolina.

I have always been passionate about plants and their ability to keep us healthy. Therefore, I have been researching some of the best natural ways that could help anyone support their healthy teeth.

So, what I did was to perfect an easy, yet powerful formula, which consists of amazing vitamins and plants, such as Vitamins A, C, D3 & K2, phosphorous, potassium, zinc, micro-encapsulated calcium (MEC), xylitol, collagen, MSM and spearmint/peppermint.</p><br>

  <p>I Truly Believe This Formula Is A Work Of Art!
And I will be more than happy to share it with anyone who needs it.

A formula that will support the health of your teeth, keeping them strong and your breath fresh.

Before turning this formula into a supplement, I made sure that it is:


Are natural, sourced from local growers that let plants reach their full maturity and use no chemical treatments.


Are mixed in the right way and in the right amount to keep their properties intact.


Are processed under strict sterile standards with regularly disinfected equipment.</p><br>
